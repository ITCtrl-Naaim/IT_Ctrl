          A desktop PC is a static, stationary computer that will stay on a desk
          in an office or bedroom. It usually consists of various parts: a
          tower, a monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse. PCs are generally more
          customizable than laptops as well. You can put together
          top-of-the-line parts for every aspect of the PC when you choose a
          desktop computer, whereas your choices are more limited with a laptop.
          Check out our pick of the best desktop PCs to see what this form
          factor has to offer. A laptop (also called a notebook) is a portable,
          all-in-one device that usually has USB inputs on the sides for
          optional peripherals. Laptops have a built-in screen, a built-in
          keyboard, a trackpad that acts as a mouse, and can vary in size.
          Laptops are generally limited by their size but many modern batteries
          are big enough to provide 12 or more hours of power before needing to
          recharge. We've collected together the best laptops as well.

          A laptop is the best option for students who are going to school
          outside of the home every day, and need a computer for classes. While
          laptops are more delicate than desktop PCs, you can now find rugged
          laptops that will take a fall or two without being destroyed. Laptops
          are best used for light work: reading, word processing, streaming
          videos, or using social media. If you or your child wants to have
          freedom to roam while using a computer, a fully charged laptop should

          On June 13, 2016, Microsoft announced the Xbox One S at E3 2016, which
          featured a smaller form factor, as well as support for 4K video
          (including streaming and Ultra HD Blu-ray) and HDR. At E3 2017,
          Microsoft unveiled Xbox One X, a high-end model with improved hardware
          designed to facilitate the playing of games at 4K resolution. Since
          November 2014, Microsoft has stated it will not release sales numbers
          for the Xbox One line. Industry estimates project global sales of the
          Xbox One family to be about 51 million units. Xbox head Phil Spencer
          said that while they do internally track sales figures, they do not
          want their developers to be focused on these numbers as to affect
          their products, and thus have opted not to report further sales of
          Xbox hardware going forward.

          The fourth generation of Xbox models, simply named Xbox, includes the
          Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S that launched on November 10, 2020.
          Both are considered members of the ninth generation of video game
          consoles alongside the PlayStation 5, also released that month. The
          Xbox Series X and Series S are high- and low-end versions comparable
          to the Xbox One X and Xbox One S models, respectively, with all games
          designed for this model family playable on both systems. The Xbox
          Series X is estimated to be four times as powerful as Xbox One X, with
          support for 8K resolution and up to 120 frames-per-second rendering,
          with a nominal target of 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. The
          Xbox Series S is a digital-only unit with less graphic processing
          power, but can still render at a nominal 1440p resolution at 60 frames
          per second with support for 4K upscaling. Both consoles features
          support for new graphics rendering systems including real-time
          ray-tracing, and the new Xbox Velocity Architecture that works with
          the internal SSD drive to maximize the rate of texture streaming to
          the graphics processor, among other features. Besides games for this
          new console family, both consoles are fully compatible with all Xbox
          One games and most hardware, as well as all backward compatible games
          that were playable on the Xbox One from the Xbox 360 and original Xbox
          console. To help transition consumers, Microsoft introduced its Smart
          Delivery system which most of its first-party games and several
          third-party games will use to offer free updates to Xbox One versions
          of games to the Xbox Series X/S version over the first few years of
          the consoles' launch.

          The PlayStation 5 is powered by a custom system on a chip (SoC)
          designed in tandem by AMD and Sony, integrating a custom 7 nm AMD Zen
          2 CPU with eight cores running at a variable frequency capped at 3.5
          GHz. The integrated GPU is also a custom unit based on AMD's RDNA 2
          graphics architecture. The GPU has 36 compute units running at a
          variable frequency capped at 2.23 GHz, making it capable of a peak
          theoretical performance of 10 teraFLOPS. The GPU supports
          hardware-accelerated real-time ray tracing, a rendering technique that
          allows for realistic lighting and reflections.
        </p>
        <p>
          The console has 16 GB of GDDR6 SDRAM with a peak bandwidth of 448
          GB/s,and integrates Bluetooth 5.1, and 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6). Both the
          CPU and GPU are monitored by a special boost system incorporating
          AMD's SmartShift technology that adjusts the frequency of these units
          based on the current activities of both to target ideal constant power
          drawn and a model SoC performance profile.[clarification needed] For
          example, if the CPU is running at lower activity, the boost system may
          reduce its frequency and increase the frequency of the GPU for higher
          performance without otherwise affecting power use or cooling. The
          cooling system includes a double-sided cooling fan for air intake that
          is 120 mm in diameter and 45 mm thick, and a large heat sink with a
          standard heat pipe design that Sony says has a "shape and airflow
          [which] make it possible to achieve the same performance as a vapor
          chamber". SoC cooling includes a liquid metal thermal conductor which
          sits between the SoC and heat sink. The system contains a 350-watt
          power supply. Sony developed the PlayStation 5 to consume less energy
          than the PlayStation 4 for suspended gameplay states. The console has
          a new audio technology called Tempest Engine, allowing hundreds of
          simultaneous sound sources compared to 50 for the PlayStation 4.

            Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that employs pose
            tracking and 3D near-eye displays to give the user an immersive feel
            of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include
            entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical
            or military training) and business (such as virtual meetings). Other
            distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and
            mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR,
            although definitions are currently changing due to the nascence of
            the industry. Currently, standard virtual reality systems use either
            virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate
            realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's
            physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual
            reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move
            around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The
            effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a
            head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but
            can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple
            large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates auditory and
            video feedback.

            "Virtual" has had the meaning of "being something in essence or
            effect, though not actually or in fact" since the mid-1400s. The
            term "virtual" has been used in the computer sense of "not
            physically existing but made to appear by software" since 1959.

            tasks such as video editing. Many gamers and computer enthusiasts
            choose to overclock their CPUs and GPUs in order to gain extra
            performance. The added power draw needed to overclock either
            processing units often requires additional cooling, usually by air
            cooling or water cooling.

            The Commodore 64 was the most powerful computer for its time in
            1982, featuring an MOS Technology 6510 CPU with 64 kb of RAM. It
            could display up to "40 columns and 25 lines of text" along with 16
            colors on its 320x200 resolution screen. Over time, technology
            progressed to where these specifications became outdated and
            computer hardware continued to evolve than what was possible before.
            Today, many modern general-purpose use computers have basic
            specifications for the average user, such as a Lenovo Chromebook
            C340-11, which as 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of internal storage, a
            dedicated graphics card, Intel Celeron N4000, and has a 1366x768
            resolution screen with some variants offering touch screen
            capabilities. Gaming computers take these specs to another level
            such as the Alienware Area-51M R2 Gaming Laptop, which features the
            latest Intel Core i9 processor with 10 cores, a dedicated graphics
            card with 8 GB of VRAM, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of internal
            storage. Gaming laptops generally do not offer touch screen
            displays.

          Computer graphics deals with generating images with the aid of
          computers. Today, computer graphics is a core technology in digital
          photography, film, video games, cell phone and computer displays, and
          many specialized applications. A great deal of specialized hardware
          and software has been developed, with the displays of most devices
          being driven by computer graphics hardware. It is a vast and recently
          developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960 by
          computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of
          Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, or typically in the context of

          Some topics in computer graphics include user interface design, sprite
          graphics, rendering, ray tracing, geometry processing, computer
          animation, vector graphics, 3D modeling, shaders, GPU design, implicit
          surfaces, visualization, scientific computing, image processing,
          computational photography, scientific visualization, computational
          geometry and computer vision, among others. The overall methodology
          depends heavily on the underlying sciences of geometry, optics,
          physics, and perception. Simulated flight over Trenta valley in the

          image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer. It is also
          used for processing image data received from the physical world, such
          as photo and video content. Computer graphics development has had a
          significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized
          animation, movies, advertising, video games, in general.

          A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to
          carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation)
          automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations
          known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide
          range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that
          includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and
          peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term
          may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function
          together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

          A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as
          control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens
          and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like
          industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as
          general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices
          like smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions
          of other computers and users.
